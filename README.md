## Documentation

### Export

As seen in the image below in the actor sheet there is an **Export to PDF** button in the toolbar

![Button](img/button.png)

By pressing it you can choose to either use the default PDF that comes with the module (by pressing **Apply**) or to upload your own PDF (by choosing the button **Override mapping's PDF**).

![Export to PDF](img/export.png)

Applying the data to the PDF could require some time so wait untill it is finished and presents the following content:

![Alt text](img/export-applyed.png)

By pressing the round printer button the PDF is generated and downloaded to your computer.

### Settings

The settings form presents the drop down list for choosing the mapping for the game system of the world for your game; after saving a refresh will be asked.

![Settings](img/settings.png)

The **Edit internal mapping** button opens a dialog to see the content of the mapping file; you will be able to change the scripting of the mapping but beware since this could break the mapping, the advice is to download the mapping file from the module and to customize it by using the custom mapping option.

![edit mapping](img/edit-mapping.png)

The button **Generate mapping from PDF** allows you to generate the mapping file from the PDF file you will upload: you will get a json file with all PDF fields listed and all the mapping empty for you to complete.

The button **Set custom mapping** in the settings form allows you to upload yours json and PDF files.
